# To Do

- Add trigger that automatically creates that profile. We can default color and attempt to change it with a subsequent request
- Update user menu to include the email as well as the avatar
- Comprehensive component and e2e cypress tests
  - figure out how to mock creating a user or something
- Do some notification stuff
- Once auth is tidy I can move on to the actual fun stuff
