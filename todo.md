# To Do

- Make list look great
  - Mess around with a cool way to only allow deletion if item is completed
  - Make a good empty state
  - Switch up the form. Maybe move save to second line
-

# At some point

- use zod to help out with better type safety from supabase
- How do we manage offline features?
  - maybe try a branch with react query
  - is it worth bringing in something like replicache? Might be fun
