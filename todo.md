# To Do

- Create lists list component
- Lists CRUD with SUPABASE
  - don't forget about MSW
- should I get things working with supabase now, or get it working locally?
  - Maybe try to do the supabase route to get something working, then attack storing it locally and other fun jazz

# Chores

- probably due for package updates
- I need to rearrange the project
  - I think I'm going to ignore this for now

# Stuff that might get easier in the next version of NextJS

- add a second layout for unauthed stuff
  - could make this myself, but improvements here are coming in the next nextjs version
- try adding stories for the pages
  - can I create a folder for each page with an index that exports the page?
  - this stuff is coming later in Next.js forget about it for now
