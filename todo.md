# To Do

- Comprehensive component and e2e cypress tests
  - just need to add component tests for the auth form
- Set up CI and make sure all the tests can run
- Do some notification stuff

# Chores

- I need to rearrange the project
- try using hygen for scaffolding components
- maybe add husky. IDK if I care that much
- update dependencies... GUH

# Stuff that might get easier in the next version of NextJS

- add a second layout for unauthed stuff
  - could make this myself, but improvements here are coming in the next nextjs version
- try adding stories for the pages
  - can I create a folder for each page with an index that exports the page?
  - this stuff is coming later in Next.js forget about it for now
