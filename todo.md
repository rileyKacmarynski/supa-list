# To Do

## Next 13 came out!!!

- Move components to app folder
  - will need to use uses or client component for client side rendering stuff
- Create stories for each page
  - I think this should be pretty simple
- Figure out how to do side list nav as a nested layout
- Create lists list component
- Lists CRUD with SUPABASE
  - don't forget about MSW
- should I get things working with supabase now, or get it working locally?
  - Maybe try to do the supabase route to get something working, then attack storing it locally and other fun jazz
