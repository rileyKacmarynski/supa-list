# To Do

- get CRUD working for items
  - don't forget about MSW
  - Figure out how we're going to handle reordering
- Work on styling list

# At some point

- How do we manage offline features?
  - maybe try a branch with react query
  - is it worth bringing in something like replicache? Might be fun
